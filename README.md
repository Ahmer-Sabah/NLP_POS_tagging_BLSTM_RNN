# NLP_POS_tagging_BLSTM_RNN
Using Bi-directional LSTM RNN to perform POS Tagging

We have used Kaggle notebooks to implement our task.



To run the code:
Upload .ipynb to Kaggle notebook environment and execute all the code cells.



To directly load and test the model
   from keras.models import load_model
   load_model('10_Project_2_TT.h5')
